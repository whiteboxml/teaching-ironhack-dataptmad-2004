    "- Writing simple code allows you to be more productive and prevents your code from running into unnecessary errors. It also makes your code more readable, easier to be debugged, and easier to be updated\n",
    "\n",
    "- Programming has a human/social dimension. At the end of the day the machine is not the only consumer of your code. Your colleagues will read your code because coding is often team work. Your mentor/supervisor will read your code because they need to evaluate your work. You yourself will read your own code because you need to debug errors. If you are in the open-source community there will also be strangers reading your code because they need to build their codes on top of yours. The simplicity of code allows it to be easily understood by human programmers\n",
    "\n",
    "- In order to write simple codes, you need to develop design thinking. There is a famous saying that everybody who writes software is a designer. You write codes to solve problems and to help people. To sum up, please think for a bit before writing thounsands of dirty lines\n",

    "- The \"keep it simple, stupid\" (KISS) principle states that your code should not attempt to achieve unnecessary, \"smart\" features. The more complicated your code is, the more error-prone and less maintainable it becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "- The KISS principle is related to the \"You Aren't Gonna Need It\" (YAGNI) and the Lean Software Development. These principles state that you shouldn't add features to your code unless you absolutely know they are needed\n",
    "\n",
    "- Follow the \"don't repeat yourself\" (DRY) principle. Copy-n-pasting is indeed easy for you to get things done. However, when people read your code it'll be a big waste of time. When you want to fix an error in your code you will also need to make the fix multiple times. The right approach here is to write a function with variables so that you can reuse the same piece of code"
